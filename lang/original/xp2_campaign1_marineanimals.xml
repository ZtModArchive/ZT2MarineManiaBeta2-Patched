      <OrcaOverviewShort>Raise an orphaned orca calf to maturity. Complete all the scenarios in this campaign to unlock the Blue Whale Hall.
      </OrcaOverviewShort>
      <OrcaOverview>Sometimes while hunting prey an individual orca may strand itself on shore. Much more rare are mass strandings of orcas, where entire pods of orcas strand themselves on the beach. Scientists do not know exactly why these mass strandings occur. 
      <p/>
      Arluq, a young female, is the sole survivor rescued from a mass orca stranding in the Arctic. She is being kept at a temporary facility, while officials from the Orca Rescue and Care Association look for a permanent home for her. The association wants to place her in a well-established zoo with adequate financial resources.
      <p/>
      If you earn $10,000 in donations for her care, the association can donate Arluq to your zoo!
      </OrcaOverview>
      
      <OrcaBasicNeeds>You did such an excellent job in raising donations that the Orca Rescue and Care Association donated Arluq to your zoo! You'll find Arluq, the young orca calf, crated near the entrance to your zoo.
      <p/>
      Now, it's up to you to take care of this magnificent animal. Build an exhibit for her and take care of all her basic needs.
      </OrcaBasicNeeds>
      
      <OrcaEnrichment>Arluq seems to be adjusting well to her new exhibit. As a reward for your quick action, your zoo's board of directors awarded you a $10,000 bonus.
      <p/>
      You need to make sure Arluq doesn't get bored! Orcas are intelligent, active predators that require constant stimulation. Your next goal is to obtain three different enrichment items -- a clam bubbler, a pursuit ball, and a seal prey dummy -- to meet Arluq's stimulation needs.
      </OrcaEnrichment>
      
      <OrcaCare>
      You did a fine job with Arluq! The Orca Rescue and Care Association wants you to continue caring for her for the next three months. Then, one of their inspectors will assess her situation and make a recommendation for her future.
      </OrcaCare>
      
      <OrcaReleaseDonations>
      Three months passed and an inspector from the Orca Rescue and Care Association assessed Arluq's current living environment. He's concerned that her social needs are not being met. Orcas are very social animals that do not do well in isolation. The inspector's recommendation is that you release Arluq into the wild, where she can interact with other orcas. He's confident that this is the best decision for her future health and happiness.
      <p/>
      Transporting and safely releasing a large marine animal like an orca is expensive! You need to raise $25,000 in donations for the orca before returning Arluq to the wild.
      </OrcaReleaseDonations>
      
      <OrcaReleaseToWild>
      Outstanding work! You raised more than $25,000 for Arluq's safe release. It's time now for her to return home. Release Arluq to the wild to complete the scenario.
      </OrcaReleaseToWild>
      
      <OrcaReleaseToWildSuccess>
      You returned Arluq to her home waters, far north in the Arctic. Using Arluq's vocal patterns, scientists located a pod of related orcas and were able to release her near her relatives. You could tell from her excited vocalizations and belly flops that Arluq was thrilled to be with others of her kind! She joined the pod, and they accepted her. Arluq is now living happily among them as they patrol the vast ocean.
      </OrcaReleaseToWildSuccess> 
      
      <OrcaBreed>
      Three months passed and an inspector from the Orca Rescue and Care Association assessed Arluq's current living situation. He says that you did an excellent job raising Arluq in a zoo environment and that it's time to take the next step. He says that you should introduce male orcas to Arluq to breed her. When she has her calf, you complete the scenario!     
      </OrcaBreed>
      
      <OrcaBreedSuccess>
      There's a new arrival at your zoo... Arluq is now a proud mother! You started a whole new orca community in your zoo.
      </OrcaBreedSuccess>
           
      <OrcaSuccessOverview>
      You did an excellent job raising a young orca calf to maturity and caring for her. Arluq is doing wonderfully, and it's all due to your hard work!
