      <FiveStarShowOverview>Your terrific track record for creating popular marine shows attracted the attention of the owners of a small zoo. They want you to manage their zoo and build a 5-star marine show. You can develop the zoo and show any way you like.
      <p/>
      There's just one catch -- the zoo's owners can't afford to give you much money at the start. Instead, they plan to provide you a cash grant for each star of show fame you earn. To start, they promise to pay you a $10,000 cash grant after you create them a 1-star show.
      </FiveStarShowOverview>

      <FiveStarShowTwoStars>
      Your fledgling show earned 1 star of fame! The owners gave you a $10,000 cash grant as promised. They'll give you another cash grant -- this one for $20,000 -- after your show reaches 2 stars of fame.

       <FiveStarShowFiveStars>
