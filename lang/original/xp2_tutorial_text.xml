      <openTankBuildingTab>Click the Tank Building tab.</openTankBuildingTab>
      <openTankBuildingTabCompleted>Building tank walls is a lot like building fences. There are three basic tank wall modes -- Freeform Tank Placement, Rectangular Tank Placement, and Octagonal Tank Placement. You'll want to start in Rectangular Tank Placement mode. Click the Check button to continue.</openTankBuildingTabCompleted>

      <placeTankWalls>See the large rectangle outlined in the dirt at the end of the path? You're going to place your tank there. Click the upper left corner of the rectangle, near the fountain. Drag the pointer to the lower right corner, near the flower bed. Be sure your acrylic tank fully covers the rectangle outlined in the dirt, and then click to place it.</placeTankWalls>
      <placeTankWallsCompleted>Well done! Now let's add a tank entrance and a donation box. Click the Check button to continue.</placeTankWallsCompleted>
      <placeTankEntranceHeading>Tank Entrance</placeTankEntranceHeading>
      <placeTankEntrance>Rectangular Tank Placement mode automatically prompts you to place a tank entrance and donation box after building a tank. Notice a tank entrance on the end of your pointer? To add an entrance, point to the location on the tank wall where you want the entrance to go.  Click to place your tank entrance.</placeTankEntrance>
      <placeTankEntranceCompleted>Since zookeepers and trainers can't enter a tank without a tank entrance, always place a tank entrance on a tank wall after you building a tank. Click the Check button to continue.</placeTankEntranceCompleted>

      <lowerTankFloorToolCompleted>You can also raise tank floors, decreasing a tank's depth. The Raise Tank Floor tool works like the Lower Tank Floor tool. Click the Check button to continue.</lowerTankFloorToolCompleted>
      <selectLandscapingHeading>Landscaping</selectLandscapingHeading>
      <selectLandscaping>When you first place a tank, the tank's water uses the biome of the terrain on which the tank is placed. Since this tank is on grassland, its water is perfect for the grasslands biome. Let's change it to the reef biome, so we can put a manta ray in the tank.

      <hybridTankIntroHeading>Hybrid Tanks</hybridTankIntroHeading>
      <hybridTankIntro>There are two different ways to construct a hybrid tank -- a tank that combines tank walls with a land exhibit. Hybrid tanks are perfect for animals that live both on land and in water. Click the Check button to continue.</hybridTankIntro>
      <hybridTankIntroCompleted>Take a look at the polar bear exhibit in this zoo. It's a hybrid tank. Now you're going to build something like it! Click the Check button to continue.</hybridTankIntroCompleted>
      <scrollToCoastalHeading>Coastal Exhibit</scrollToCoastalHeading>
      <scrollToCoastal>Situated next to the polar bear exhibit is an empty coastal exhibit. There's a popcorn stand in front of it. Scroll over to the coastal exhibit. Click the Check button to continue.</scrollToCoastal>

      <selectDitch>Click the Create Valley tool, and then paint a valley along the front of the tank wall, near the popcorn stand and donation box.</selectDitch>
      <selectDitchCompleted>You did it! Let's move on. You can go back later to work on the details, like smoothing out the path. Don't forget, when you do go back, to add some California sea lions to the exhibit. They thrive in hybrid tanks! Click the Check button to continue.</selectDitchCompleted>
      <scrollToPelagicHeading>Pelagic Tank</scrollToPelagicHeading>
      <scrollToPelagic>Let's learn another, even easier, way to make a hybrid tank. Find the pelagic tank next to the coastal exhibit -- the one with leatherback sea turtles in it, and then scroll to it.</scrollToPelagic>
      <scrollToPelagicCompleted>At the back of the pelagic tank is a fenced area with a treasure chest. We're going to combine the fenced area and the pelagic tank to create a hybrid tank. You can do it in one step! Click the Check button to continue.</scrollToPelagicCompleted>
      <pullDownTankWallHeading>Pull Down Tank Wall</pullDownTankWallHeading>
      <pullDownTankWall>Place your pointer on top of the back tank wall -- the wall nearest the treasure chest. When the pointer becomes a hand icon, press and hold the SHIFT key. Then click and drag the tank wall in a downward direction.</pullDownTankWall>
      <putDownTankWallCompleted>Using the SHIFT key this way lets you lower just one tank wall to give the animals access to both the water and land areas of the exhibit. You just created a hybrid tank!</putDownTankWallCompleted>

      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial, you learn two different ways to train marine animals to do tricks, which guests really enjoy watching. When you're ready to start, click the Check button.</welcome>
      <trainingIntroHeading>Training Animals</trainingIntroHeading>
      <trainingIntro>In Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania, you can train certain marine animals to perform trained behaviors, or tricks, which can then be performed at marine shows. Click the Check button to continue.</trainingIntro>
      <trainingIntroCompleted>You can train animals in any tank with a tank entrance and a training area. Not all marine animals can be trained -- you can't, for instance, train a great white shark! Dolphins, though, are quick learners and do all sorts of tricks. Let's teach the bottlenose dolphin in this tank the Jump trick. Click the Check button to continue.</trainingIntroCompleted>
      <selectDolphinHeading>Select Dolphin</selectDolphinHeading>
      <selectDolphin>Find Beaky, a bottlenose dolphin, in the tank. Click Beaky to select him.</selectDolphin>
      <selectDolphinCompleted>Awesome! When you select an animal, the Animal Information panel appears in the lower right corner of your screen. Click the Check button to continue.</selectDolphinCompleted>
      <openTrainingHeading>Train Animal</openTrainingHeading>
      <openTraining>Click the Train In 1st Person button, point to the spot in Beaky's tank where you want the training area to go, and then click.</openTraining>
      <!--note that we're now back to using the completion text, and it also contains info on training areas.-->
      <openTrainingCompleted>Training areas are required to teach tricks. If a training area isn't in the tank when you click the Train In 1st Person button, you are automatically prompted to place one. Click the Check button to continue.</openTrainingCompleted>
      
      <!-- The following step is no longer used
      
      <placeTrainingAreaHeading>Place Training Area</placeTrainingAreaHeading>
      <placeTrainingArea>Click in Beaky's tank to place the training area.</placeTrainingArea>
      <placeTrainingAreaCompleted>The Train Animal panel opens automatically whenever you add a training area. The Train Animal panel displays all the tricks that animal can learn. Each trick has a training level, indicating how well-trained that animal is on particular tricks. Right now, Beaky doesn't know any tricks, but you'll change that! Click the Check button to continue.</placeTrainingAreaCompleted> -->
      
      <selectJumpHeading>Jump in Trick Area</selectJumpHeading>
      <selectJump>The Train Animal panel shows the tricks that animal can learn. The training level shows how well the animal knows each trick. Right now, Beaky doesn't know much about any of the tricks. Let's teach him one! Click the Jump in Trick Area button to enter Training mode.</selectJump>
      <selectJumpCompleted>In Training mode, you use the training wand to train animals. You do this by tracing a gesture, or movement, with the training wand. Click the Check button to continue.</selectJumpCompleted>
      <gestureIntroHeading>Tracing Gestures</gestureIntroHeading>
      <gestureIntro>In animal training, the tracer moves along a gesture line. The tracer is a ring with an arrow attached. It's located to the left of the gesture line. The gesture line is the large yellow line that curves in front of you. Your task is to keep the training wand over the tracer as it moves along the gesture line. Click the Check button to continue.</gestureIntro>
      <gestureIntroCompleted>Occasionally, you need to press special keys while tracing a gesture. In this trick, you need to click at the top of the curve. Other tricks, for example, require you to press one of the ARROW keys. Click the Check button to continue.</gestureIntroCompleted>
      <makeGestureOneHeading>Begin Training</makeGestureOneHeading>
      <makeGestureOne></makeGestureOne>
      <makeGestureOneCompleted>When you're ready, click the Check button to close this window, and then click the tracer to start training.</makeGestureOneCompleted>
      <!--NOTE: the tutorial box should disappear after "Ready to give it a try..." and not re-appear until after the training is over.-->
      <rewardDolphinOneHeading>Reward Dolphin</rewardDolphinOneHeading>
      <rewardDolphinOne>Press SPACEBAR to reward Beaky with a fish.</rewardDolphinOne>
      <rewardDolphinOneCompleted>A few things to remember about tricks and training: Animals learn faster when you reward them. The higher an animal's trick score, the more it learns. As an animal's training level in a trick increases, it performs that trick better. When an animal masters a trick, it may unlock new tricks. Click the Check button to continue.</rewardDolphinOneCompleted>
      <selectJumpTwoHeading>Jump in Trick Area</selectJumpTwoHeading>
      <selectJumpTwo>Let's try the same trick again, so we can learn a few advanced techniques. Click the Jump in Trick Area button to enter Training mode.</selectJumpTwo>
      <selectJumpTwoCompleted>Keep a close eye on the tracer as it moves. Notice how little sparks shoot from the tracer. Pay attention to the color of the sparks. Green sparks indicate you're doing well. Yellow and orange sparks indicate you're falling behind a bit. Red sparks indicate you're not earning any points because your training wand is too far away from the tracer. Click the Check button to continue.</selectJumpTwoCompleted>
      <makeGestureTwoHeading>Begin Training</makeGestureTwoHeading>
      <makeGestureTwo></makeGestureTwo>
      <makeGestureTwoCompleted>To return to training, click the Check button to close this window, and then click the tracer.</makeGestureTwoCompleted>
      <!--NOTE: the tutorial box should disappear after "Ready to give it a try..." and not reappear until after the training is over.-->
      <rewardDolphinTwoHeading>Reward Dolphin</rewardDolphinTwoHeading>
      <rewardDolphinTwo>Good work! Press SPACEBAR to reward Beaky with a fish.</rewardDolphinTwo>
      <rewardDolphinTwoCompleted>The more you train an animal on a trick, the better it gets. The better an animal is at a trick, the harder it becomes to further train that trick. Each trick has three levels of training difficulty. As you move from one difficulty level to the next, you may notice that the tracer moves faster, that there are more keys to press, or that a gesture's shape changes. Click the Check button to continue.</rewardDolphinTwoCompleted>
      <closePanelHeading>Close Train Animal Panel</closePanelHeading>
      <closePanel>While it's fun to train your own animals, you can also hire trainers to train them for you. Let's learn how to use trainers. First, close the Train Animal panel.</closePanel>
      <closePanelCompleted>null</closePanelCompleted>
      <openStaffPanelHeading>Staff</openStaffPanelHeading>

      <placeTrainerHeading>Place Trainer</placeTrainerHeading>
      <placeTrainer>Click the trainer icon, and then click anywhere in your zoo to place a trainer.</placeTrainer>
      <placeTrainerCompleted>Trainers function a lot like zookeepers. A trainer without any special assignments automatically seeks out marine animals to train. Trainers can only train marine animals that are able to learn tricks. The animal must also be happy before a trainer can train it. Click the Check button to continue.</placeTrainerCompleted>

      <clickDolphinCompleted>Well done! Beaky's name now appears on the assignment list. The trainer you selected is now assigned to train Beaky. Click the Check button to continue.</clickDolphinCompleted>
      <clickAnimalButtonHeading>Trainer's Training Panel</clickAnimalButtonHeading>
      <clickAnimalButton>Even though you assigned your animal to a trainer, you can still specify the tricks you want it to learn. Click the button next to Beaky's name on the assignment list.</clickAnimalButton>
      <clickAnimalButtonCompleted>Choose from the available trick icons to specify which tricks you want Beaky to learn. A check mark next to a trick icon indicates you assigned the trainer to teach that trick. If all the tricks are checked, the trainer teaches all of them to the animal, starting with the easiest ones. Click the Check button on this window to continue.</clickAnimalButtonCompleted>
      <trainingMultipleAnimalsHeading>Training Multiple Animals</trainingMultipleAnimalsHeading>
      <trainingMultipleAnimals>You can assign a single trainer to train multiple animals in multiple tanks. Of course, the more animals you assign to a trainer the less time the trainer has with each animal. If you assign a trainer to teach animals in different tanks, know that it takes time for the trainer to travel between tanks. Click the Check button to continue.</trainingMultipleAnimals>
      <trainingMultipleAnimalsCompleted>Remember, trainers can only train animals in tanks that have both a tank entrance (a platform with a ladder) and a training area. Click the Check button to continue.</trainingMultipleAnimalsCompleted>

      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial, you learn how to create and schedule marine shows. When you're ready to start, click the Check button.</welcome>
      <showIntroHeading>Show Tanks</showIntroHeading>
      <showIntro>To create a marine show, you first need a show tank. A show tank is different from an exhibit tank in two respects. First, only a show tank uses a show platform. Second, although marine animals perform in show tanks, they can't live in them full time -- it's hard to eat or sleep when a show is happening in your house! Click the Check button to continue.</showIntro>
      <showIntroCompleted>This zoo has three tanks. There's a bottlenose dolphin in one and an orca in another. The middle tank is empty, which makes it perfect for a show tank! After constructing a show tank, you can create marine shows featuring the dolphin and the orca. Click the Check button to continue.</showIntroCompleted>
      <openConstructionPanelHeading>Construction Panel</openConstructionPanelHeading>
      <openConstructionPanel>To build a show tank, you need to add a show platform to the tank. Click the Construction button to begin.</openConstructionPanel>
      <openConstructionPanelCompleted>The show platform is located on the new Show and Tank Objects panel. Click the Check button to continue.</openConstructionPanelCompleted>
      <openShowObjectsHeading>Show and Tank Objects</openShowObjectsHeading>
      <openShowObjects>Click the Show and Tank Objects tab.</openShowObjects>

      <placeShowPlatformHeading>Show Platform</placeShowPlatformHeading>
      <placeShowPlatform>Click the show platform, point to the spot in the tank where you want it to go, and click. Note that you can only place the show platform next to a tank wall.</placeShowPlatform>
      <placeShowPlatformCompleted>The MC runs marine shows from the show platform. You also use the show platform to schedule marine shows. Click the Check button to continue.</placeShowPlatformCompleted>
      <placeDolphinPortalHeading>Show Portal</placeDolphinPortalHeading>
      <placeDolphinPortal>Whenever you add a show platform, you're automatically prompted to place show portals. Show portals let your animals travel from the exhibit tank, where they live, to the show tank, where they perform. Let's place a show portal that connects the dolphin's exhibit tank to the show tank. You already have a show portal on your pointer, so just click the tank wall between the two tanks to place it. Note that you can only place show portals on show tank walls.</placeDolphinPortal>

      <placeOrcaPortalHeading>Show Portal</placeOrcaPortalHeading>
      <placeOrcaPortal>Next, let's place a show portal that connects the orca's exhibit tank to the show tank. You should still have a show portal on your pointer. Click the tank wall between the two tanks to place a portal for the orca.</placeOrcaPortal>
      <placeOrcaPortalCompleted>Since animals only use their show portals when they are scheduled to perform, the orca cannot swim through the dolphin's portal and attack the dolphin. Click the Check button to continue.</placeOrcaPortalCompleted>
      <dolphinShowPortal>Place a show portal on the tank wall between the dolphin's tank and the show tank!</dolphinShowPortal>

      <!--Large Grandstand is also known as Grandstand III-->
      <placeGrandstandHeading>Large Grandstand</placeGrandstandHeading>
      <placeGrandstand>Let's add a large grandstand, so guests can sit and enjoy your marine show. Place it in front of the show tank with the seats facing the tank. The space between the flower beds is a nice spot. Click the large grandstand, and then click the spot where you want it to go.</placeGrandstand>
      <placeGrandstandCompleted>Brilliant! Click the Check button to continue.</placeGrandstandCompleted>

      <selectDeepWaterHeading>Deep Water</selectDeepWaterHeading>
      <selectDeepWater>The coastal biome has already been selected for you. Most of the show animals are comfortable in coastal water. Click the Deep Water button, and then click the water in the tank.</selectDeepWater>
      <selectDeepWaterCompleted>You did it! The bottlenose dolphin and the orca should be much happier performing in the show tank now. Click the Check button to continue.</selectDeepWaterCompleted>
      <selectShowPlatformHeading>Select Show Platform</selectShowPlatformHeading>
      <selectShowPlatform>Let's put on a show! To create a show, click the show platform in the show tank.</selectShowPlatform>
      <selectShowPlatformCompleted>The Show Platform Information panel lets you edit, delete, and also order and reorder shows. First, though, you need to create a show. Click the Check button to continue.</selectShowPlatformCompleted>
      <createShowHeading>Create Show</createShowHeading>
      <createShow>Click the Create Show button.</createShow>
      <createShowCompleted>You should see the Show Mixer. The Show Mixer lets an animal perform multiple tricks during a show. It also lets several animals perform tricks at the same time. We're going to create a simple show using the dolphin and the orca. Click the Check button to continue.</createShowCompleted>
      <chooseAnimalOneHeading>Add Animal</chooseAnimalOneHeading>
      <chooseAnimalOne>First, add the dolphin to the show. Click Add Animal, and then select the bottlenose dolphin from the list.</chooseAnimalOne>
      <chooseAnimalOneCompleted>Note that the list only includes show animals in exhibit tanks with a show portal connected to a show tank. Click the Check button to continue.</chooseAnimalOneCompleted>
      <chooseAnimalTwoHeading>Add Animal</chooseAnimalTwoHeading>
      <chooseAnimalTwo>Let's have the orca perform in the show, too. Click Add Animal again, and then select the orca from the list.</chooseAnimalTwo>
      <chooseAnimalTwoCompleted>Now that both animals are added to the show, let's assign tricks to them. For the show's first act, let's have the dolphin and the orca perform their tricks at the same time. Click the Check button to continue.</chooseAnimalTwoCompleted>
      <assignAnimalOneTrickOneHeading>Add New Trick</assignAnimalOneTrickOneHeading>
      <assignAnimalOneTrickOne>To assign a trick to the bottlenose dolphin, click the dolphin's Add New Trick button, and then select a trick from the list.</assignAnimalOneTrickOne>
      <assignAnimalOneTrickOneCompleted>Whenever you assign a trick to an animal, a trick area is automatically created. All show animals perform their tricks in a trick area ringed by buoys. You can pick up the trick area and move it anywhere you want in the show tank. You can also do the same thing with most show props. Click the Check button to continue.</assignAnimalOneTrickOneCompleted>
      <assignAnimalTwoTrickHeading>Add New Trick</assignAnimalTwoTrickHeading>
      <assignAnimalTwoTrick>Now that you scheduled the dolphin's first trick, let's do the same for the orca. Click the orca's Add New Trick button, and then select a trick from the list.</assignAnimalTwoTrick>
      <assignAnimalTwoTrickCompleted>When the show starts, the dolphin and the orca are set to perform their tricks at about the same time. Click the Check button to continue.</assignAnimalTwoTrickCompleted>
      <assignAnimalOneTrickTwoHeading>Add New Trick</assignAnimalOneTrickTwoHeading>
      <assignAnimalOneTrickTwo>For our second act, let's assign the dolphin another trick. Click the bottlenose dolphin's Add New Trick button, and then select a different trick from the list.</assignAnimalOneTrickTwo>
      <assignAnimalOneTrickTwoCompleted>Note that you can name your show anything you like, especially if you find "Show 1" a bit boring. Click the Check button to continue.</assignAnimalOneTrickTwoCompleted>
      <saveShowHeading>Save and Exit</saveShowHeading>
      <saveShow>Click the Check button on the Show Mixer to save your show and exit the Show Mixer. The show platform automatically opens after you create a show.</saveShow>
      <saveShowCompleted>There are just a couple more things to do, and then you can see your show! Click the Check button to continue.</saveShowCompleted>
      <insertBreakHeading>Insert Break</insertBreakHeading>
      <insertBreak>Animals need to take a break from shows. If an animal spends too much time performing, it becomes unhappy, and unhappy animals refuse to perform. To keep the bottlenose dolphin and the orca happy, insert a break after the show. To do this, click the Insert Break button.</insertBreak>
      <insertBreakCompleted>Now sit back and enjoy your show! Note that you can watch it from the grandstands while in Zoo Guest Mode. When the show platform is open, all scheduled shows run in the order created. When all the shows play, they start again and repeat in the same order. Click the Check button to continue.</insertBreakCompleted>

      <openShowCompleted>Now sit back and enjoy your show. (You can even watch from the grandstands while in Zoo Guest Mode.) When the show platform is open, all the shows run in order: Show 1, Show 2, and so on. When all the shows play, they start again and repeat in the same order, beginning with Show 1.</openShowCompleted>

      <disableShowHeading>Disable Show</disableShowHeading>
      <disableShow>The Show Platform panel performs many important show activities. You use it to add new shows. You use it to edit, view, reorder, and delete existing shows. You also use it to temporarily disable a show. Click the Check button next to the name of the show we just created to temporarily disable it.</disableShow>
      <disableShowCompleted>Good job! Guests rate shows using a star system -- the more they like a show, the more stars they give it. Guests donate to your zoo when they like your show, so be sure to put a donation box near each show tank. Note that the popularity of each trick changes over time. Try to schedule shows that feature popular tricks, and don't forget to update your shows as other tricks gain in popularity. Click the Check button to continue.</disableShowCompleted>

   <xp2_tutorial5>
      <welcome>Welcome! In this tutorial, you learn about terrain feature filters, the Eyedropper tool, how to swim with dolphins, and other new Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania's features. When you're ready to start, click the Check button.</welcome>

      <openLandscapingHeading>Landscaping</openLandscapingHeading>
      <openLandscaping>Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania comes with a lot of cool new features. It also updates older ones. For example, landscape features -- trees, plants, and rocks -- are painted differently. Click the Landscaping button to learn how the new way works.</openLandscaping>
      <openLandscapingCompleted>The desert biome has already been selected for you. Click the Check button to continue.</openLandscapingCompleted>
      <paintLandscapeOneHeading>Paint Landscape</paintLandscapeOneHeading>
      <paintLandscapeOne>Notice that the layout of the Landscaping panel is changed. You no longer paint in terrain features by selecting biome brushes at the bottom of the panel. Instead, our new terrain feature filters let you add trees, plants, and rocks as you paint in your landscape. To learn how they work, let's paint a desert landscape into the large dirt field surrounded by flower beds that's near the zoo entrance.</paintLandscapeOne>
      <paintLandscapeOneCompleted>At this moment, all three terrain feature filters are off. When you paint your desert landscape, you won't see any trees, plants, or rocks. Click the Check button to continue.</paintLandscapeOneCompleted>
      <toggleRocksHeading>Rocks Filter</toggleRocksHeading>
      <toggleRocks>You can turn on all or any combination of the terrain filters. Simply click a terrain feature filter to activate it. Okay, you give it a try! Click the rocks filter to turn it on.</toggleRocks>
      <toggleRocksCompleted>null</toggleRocksCompleted>
      <paintLandscapeTwoHeading>Paint Landscape</paintLandscapeTwoHeading>
      <paintLandscapeTwo>Well done! Now paint some more desert landscape.</paintLandscapeTwo>
      <paintLandscapeTwoCompleted>Since the rocks filter is on, you paint in rocks while painting the desert landscape. Note that the terrain feature filters give you more precise control over what gets added or doesn't get added to your landscape. Click the Check button to continue.</paintLandscapeTwoCompleted>
      <selectTreeHeading>Select Tree</selectTreeHeading>
      <selectTree>Another new feature is the Eyedropper tool. The Eyedropper tool is a quick and easy way to place a copy of almost any object in the game. Let's use it on the balsam fir tree by the hamburger stand. Click the balsam fir tree to select it.</selectTree>
      <selectTreeCompleted>null</selectTreeCompleted>
      <copyTreeHeading>Eyedropper Tool</copyTreeHeading>
      <copyTree>Click the Eyedropper tool. Notice that an exact copy of the balsam fir appears on your pointer. Point to where you want the tree to go, and then click to place it.</copyTree>
      <copyTreeCompleted>The Eyedropper tool doesn't work on all objects. In a campaign or scenario game, it does not work on objects for which you haven't acquired enough zoo fame. The Eyedropper tool also doesn't work on items requiring research that hasn't been done. Click the Check button to continue.</copyTreeCompleted>
      <!--note we may have to force manta to be on buy panel-->
      <selectMantaRayHeading>Select Manta Ray</selectMantaRayHeading>
      <selectMantaRay>There's also another, similar way that lets you clone, or copy, animals. Find the manta ray tank, and then click a manta ray to select it.</selectMantaRay>
      <selectMantaRayCompleted>null</selectMantaRayCompleted>
      <selectRecommendationsHeading>Zookeeper Recommendations</selectRecommendationsHeading>
      <selectRecommendations>Click the Zookeeper Recommendations button.</selectRecommendations>
      <selectRecommendationsCompleted>null</selectRecommendationsCompleted>
      <clickPictureHeading>Clone Animal</clickPictureHeading>
      <clickPicture>On the Zookeeper Recommendations panel, click the manta ray icon. Drag the cloned manta ray to the manta ray tank, and then click to place it.</clickPicture>
      <clickPictureCompleted>This shortcut only works for animals listed on the Adoption panel. If an animal isn't listed on the Adoption panel, you won't be able to clone it in a scenario or challenge game. Click the Check button to continue.</clickPictureCompleted>
      <closeRecommendationsHeading>Close Zookeeper Recommendations</closeRecommendationsHeading>
      <closeRecommendations>Click the Zookeeper Recommendations button to close the Zookeeper Recommendations panel.</closeRecommendations>
      <closeRecommendationsCompleted>null</closeRecommendationsCompleted>      
      <openQuickStatsHeading>Zoo Quick Stats</openQuickStatsHeading>
      <openQuickStats>Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania has a few new ways to gather data about your zoo. Click the Zoo Quick Stats button to open the Quick Stats panel.</openQuickStats>
      <openQuickStatsCompleted>There are two new tabs on the Quick Stats panel -- the Building Information tab and the Donation Box Information tab.</openQuickStatsCompleted>
      <selectBuildingTabHeading>Building Information</selectBuildingTabHeading>
      <selectBuildingTab>The Buildings List gives you quick access to data on all the buildings in your zoo. You can see how long a building has been open, its total profit to date, and its average monthly profit. Click the Building Information tab to open the Buildings List.</selectBuildingTab>
      <selectBuildingTabCompleted>As with the other lists on the Quick Stats panel, click a building's name to go right to it. The new Donation Box Information tab gives you quick access to data on all the donation boxes in your zoo. It works the same way as the Building Information tab. Click the Check button to continue.</selectBuildingTabCompleted>
      <closeQuickStatsHeading>Close Zoo Quick Stats</closeQuickStatsHeading>
      <closeQuickStats>Click the X button on the Quick Stats panel to close the panel.</closeQuickStats>
      <closeQuickStatsCompleted>null</closeQuickStatsCompleted>
      <selectDolphinHeading>Select Dolphin</selectDolphinHeading>
      <selectDolphin>Swimming with bottlenose dolphins and other marine animals is one of Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania's most exciting new features. Let's swim with a dolphin! First, find the dolphin tank. Next, click a dolphin to select it.</selectDolphin>
      <selectDolphinCompleted>The Swim With Animal feature lets you enter the bottlenose dolphin exhibit and swim with one of these magnificent animals. Click the Check button to continue.</selectDolphinCompleted>
      <clickSwimButtonHeading>Swim With Animal</clickSwimButtonHeading>
      <clickSwimButton>Click the Swim With Animal button to swim alongside a bottlenose dolphin. Enjoy the ride!</clickSwimButton>
      <clickSwimButtonCompleted>Click the Check button when you're done swimming and want to continue the tutorial.</clickSwimButtonCompleted>
      <!--Note the player is already in Zoo Guest Mode at this point-->
      <clickOverheadViewHeading>Swimming in Zoo Guest Mode</clickOverheadViewHeading>
      <clickOverheadView>Did you know you can swim in tanks and dive underwater in Zoo Guest Mode? It works much the same way as walking around your zoo in Zoo Guest Mode. (Note that if your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can use it to dive or ascend while you swim.) Try swimming in the dolphin tank in Zoo Guest Mode. Click the Overhead View button when you're ready to return to the tutorial.</clickOverheadView>
      <clickOverheadViewCompleted>Did you know you can take photos while swimming underwater?! Click the Check button to continue.</clickOverheadViewCompleted>
      <ballPhysicsHeading>Improved Ball Physics</ballPhysicsHeading>
      <ballPhysics>Here's one more fun feature -- improved object physics. These make the animals toys and pursuit balls roll and bounce better than ever. Locate the circular pit surrounded by pursuit balls. It's near the back of the zoo. Drop some balls into the pit and watch how they roll. Try kicking the balls around in Zoo Guest Mode! When you're done, click the zoo gate to complete this tutorial.</ballPhysics>
